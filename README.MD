2. **Join the Group:**  
   After starting the bot, join the Telegram group for crowdfunding: [https://t.me/+lO8eQNkePo4wNTll](https://t.me/+lO8eQNkePo4wNTll). Here, you can enjoy anonymous funding and post your crowdfunding ideas, engaging with a community of supporters.


## What it does



1. **Post Crowdfunding Ideas:** Users can post detailed messages in a Telegram group about their crowdfunding ideas, outlining all relevant information directly within the platform.

2. **Engage and Donate:** Other users can browse through these messages, ask questions, and manage donations to the projects they find interesting—all within the Telegram group.

3. **Protect User Privacy:** Upon joining the group, each user is assigned a **Semaphore identity**, ensuring their real identity remains completely anonymous.

4. **Anonymized Messaging via Bot:** Whenever a user posts, the **mysema_bot** reads, deletes the original message and resends the message, generating a signature with the user’s Semaphore identity, allowing messages to be anonymous yet verifiable.

5. **Message Integrity Verification:** Users can easily verify the authenticity of any message by replying **/verify** to it, ensuring the message is from a trusted source.

6. **Inbuilt Crypto Wallet:** Each user is equipped with an **Ethereum wallet**, enabling them to top up funds and send **anonymous donations** using simple Telegram commands like `/send`.

Here’s the updated version of the two points, including the privacy aspect:

7. **Check Semaphore Identity:**  
   Users can check their **Semaphore identity** by using the **/id** command, allowing them to verify their anonymity in the group. The result is sent directly to the user's private messages, ensuring confidentiality and not exposing it in the group.

8. **Check Balance:**  
   Users can view their wallet balance by using the **/balance** command, providing transparency about their available funds for donations. This information is also sent privately to the user, keeping it secure and out of the group chat.

9. **Access Wallet Information:**  
   Users can use the **/wallet** command to privately receive their wallet's **private key**, **address**, and **public key**. This ensures that sensitive information is securely transmitted directly to the user's private messages, maintaining their privacy and security
